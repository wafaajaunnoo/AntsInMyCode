# 1. Introduction
For this assignment, I conceptually break down an NP-Hard combinatorial problem that I formulated - the Travelling Salesman Problem, otherwise referred to in this document as 'TSP'.  I also provide a detailed understanding of the problem, which includes the understanding of the algorithm, data structures and tests I used to execute the problem in Python.

This document is divided into the following sections:
1. [Combinatorial Problem Formulation](https://github.com/wafaajaunnoo/AntsInMyCode/blob/main/problem-formulation.md)
    * The Travelling Salesman Problem
    * Problem Complexity
2. [Intuition of the Algorithm's Operation](https://github.com/wafaajaunnoo/AntsInMyCode/blob/main/algorithm.md)
    * Pseudocode
    * Steps
3. [PEAS Definition](#)
4. [Codes and their behaviours](https://github.com/wafaajaunnoo/AntsInMyCode/blob/main/code-breakdown.md)
5. [Tests' results and analyses](https://github.com/wafaajaunnoo/AntsInMyCode/blob/main/Tests/tests.md)
  * Optimal Path Identification
