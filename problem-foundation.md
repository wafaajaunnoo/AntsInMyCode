# 2. Combinatorial Problem Formulation
A logical way to start this section is by defining a TSP.  I follow with the simplification of the problem complexity, which I define as the *constraints*, *objectives* and *miscellaneous **relevant** information that add to the complexity*.
## 2.1 The Travelling Salesman Problem

-- add def and important points, anything from research papers

-- Why the problem is NP-Hard
Briefly: The TSP is an NP-hard combinatorial optimisation problem, which means that the number of alternative solution sequences rises exponentially with the number of cities.

* no known algorithm exists to solve it in polynomial time
